## Associations

### Categoires Join Table

I made a categories join table due to the many to many relationship between categories and products.

### Product Orders

I added an additional table labeled "Product Orders" for a couple of reasons. The product orders table allows the user to store the quantity purchased for an individual product within a order. This allows the products table to solely consist of products, and not cluttered with individual order information.

## Next Steps for Project

### UI/UX
#### Calendar
I would change the date input from text boxes to a calendar on which the user can click a start date and end date.

#### Site Navigation
Make the site more user friendly by adding a "Home" button.

### Refactor
Refactor my code to make it cleaner and more efficient.

### Export to CSV

Add a button that allows the user to export the data to CSV.

### Data Structure

I would change the way the data is displayed for products sold by date range to allow the user to more easily manipulate the data and have a breakdown by day/week/month.
